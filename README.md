iOS Software Engineer with a proven ability to solve complex problems and work effectively in collaborative settings. In my past career I managed 100+ staff and provided support, resources, and assistance. I also solved productivity and attendance issues by establishing routines and training programs and by increasing efficiency to move over 30K+ of product daily in a timely manner. Always seeking personal growth, I expanded my coding acumen through attending a 1000+ hour iOS coding bootcamp focused on Swift, Objective-C & Python. I am now seeking a position on a growth minded team to find ways to build mobile applications to solve real-world problems.
